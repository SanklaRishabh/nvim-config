# Introduction

This repository contains my Neovim configuration for Windows. This configuration makes `init.lua` the main file for Neovim for terminal.

For this setup, I have used Windows Terminal as the terminal emulator and PowerShell as the default shell for Neovim.

# Install and Setup

A detailed documentation will soon be added to this repo. However, the easiest way to get started with this config is by cloning the repository into the `$env:LOCALAPPDATA\nvim\` folder. Just remove the `.git` directory after cloning and run Neovim.
